As the organization structure was quickly evolving, such HR categorization became ambiguous to students. I then turned to the traditional universities for inspiration but quickly realized that our unique model (for example, our global rotation model makes what “international students” entails very ambiguous ), was ambiguous to students. Another challenge was posed by the fact that the majority of Minerva students are from outside of the US. Therefore some of the conventional usages of terms in the US college system might not make intuitive sense to the student (for example, Work-study is overseen by the financial aid department).&nbsp;</div></div>

I used workflowy to test on different students (while taking classes on information architecture Lynda.com) and validate the proposed designs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Card sorting was a decent way to validate the ideas and organization of content. However, it was not precise and cannot be fully relied on because of subjectivity and our international student body. For example, in the US, students naturally understand work study is under the department in charge of financial aid, but at Minerva, where the majority of the student body is from outside the US, this won’t make intuitive sense and will be something that they will need to learn (which is also a potential point to include in onboarding/orientation).&nbsp;</div></div>

Therefore, before going into the full production phase, I made a content style guide for everyone that's involved with creating information on the website to familiarize themselves with.
